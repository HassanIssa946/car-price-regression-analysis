# Car Price Analysis Using Regression Models

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the relationship between various car features and their prices using different regression techniques. By understanding these relationships, we can predict car prices based on features like horsepower, curb weight, engine size, and highway-mpg.

## Introduction

In this project, we use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn` to perform regression analysis on a car dataset. We aim to understand the linear relationships between car features and their prices, and build predictive models using these relationships.

## Data Exploration

We begin by loading and exploring the dataset to understand the types of variables we are dealing with. Continuous numerical variables are visualized using scatterplots with fitted lines to observe any linear relationships.

## Correlation and Causation

### Correlation

Correlation measures the extent of interdependence between variables. The Pearson Correlation coefficient, ranging from -1 to 1, indicates the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.

### Causation

Causation indicates a cause-and-effect relationship between variables. It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Determining causation often requires independent experimentation.

## Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression helps us understand the relationship between two variables: an independent predictor variable (X) and a dependent response variable (Y). The resulting linear function predicts the response variable based on the predictor variable.

Example: Using highway-mpg to predict car price:
\[ \text{price} = 38423.31 - 821.73 \times \text{highway-mpg} \]

## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) considers multiple predictor variables to predict the response variable.

Predictors used:
- Horsepower
- Curb-weight
- Engine-size
- Highway-mpg

## Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression fits a polynomial equation to the data. It can capture non-linear relationships between variables.

### Quadratic (2nd order)
\[ \hat{Y} = a + b_1 X^2 + b_2 X^2 \]

### Cubic (3rd order)
\[ \hat{Y} = a + b_1 X^2 + b_2 X^2 + b_3 X^3 \]

Higher-order polynomials can also be used for more complex relationships.

## Model Evaluation

We evaluate our models using:
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

## Conclusion

After comparing the models, we conclude that the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model is the best for predicting car prices in our dataset. This makes sense since we have multiple potential predictors for the car price.
